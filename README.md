# Precision Object Detection and Instance Segmentation with Mask R-CNN

## 🔄 Overview:
This project focuses on utilizing the Mask R-CNN model from Tensorflow Hub to achieve precise object detection and instance segmentation. The model's ability to predict segmentation masks for each instance of a class in an image sets it apart from traditional object detection models.
